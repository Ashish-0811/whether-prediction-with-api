# whether-prediction-with-api


This project is a Python application that provides real-time weather and air quality information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The application features a login system and a graphical user interface built with Tkinter. Users can view the current weather conditions, air quality index, and a 5-day weather forecast with plotted temperature trends.
